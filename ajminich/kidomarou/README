Project Kidomarou
by AJ Minich
September-October 2012

This project seeks to properly encapsulate the ways by 
which one set of genomics files can be processed or 
converted into another set. The goal of the project is 
to simply the way in which processing pipelines are 
understood, configured, and documented. Ultimately, 
this work will become a new implementation of the 
whole-genome sequencing pipeline currently used in the 
Bina Box.

To Do
- determine whether there are Python enums
  -> FileDivision (None, Coordinate, Lane)
  -> FileType (FASTA, SAM, BAM, VCF, GFF)
  -> SortOrder (None, Coordinate, Queryname)
- create file groups for the following types:
	-> recalibrated BAM
	-> normal/recalibrated VCF
	-> GFF
