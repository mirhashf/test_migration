Please write a command line program which validates a given password against a comma separated number of rules. The rules are as follows:
Rule 1. Password must have at least 6 characters
Rule 2. Password must contain at least 1 upper case character
Rule 3. Password must contain at least 1 numeric character

For example;
java PasswordValidator abcdef 1,3 
should output false because the password abcdef does not contain any numeric characters, therefore it violates rule 3

java PasswordValidator abcde7 1,3
should output true because the password complies with both rule 1 and 3

java PasswordValidator abcde7 1,2,3
should output false because the password does not contain any upper case characters, therefore it violates rule 2

java PasswordValidator Abcde7 1,2,3
should output true

Your code should also leave room for a programmer to create his/her own rules
For example;
Another programmer using your code, should be able to define a new rule such as
Rule 9. Password must not contain the keywords "bina" or "roche"

and 
java PasswordValidator abcdebina 1,9
should output false because the password contains the keyword "bina", thereby violating rule 9.

Instructions:
1. Please send us your code written in Java, and some instructions to compile and run it. Please do NOT send us any binaries (jar, class files etc.). 
2. Also, please include a short note which describes how another programmer can change your code in order to define new rules.
