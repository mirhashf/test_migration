# Glossary

## RAVE
Read Alignment, Variant Calling and Expression

## AAiM
Annotation & Analytics Intelligent Module

### Analysis
Represents the process of analyzing a piece of data to generate another piece of data. For now GMS limits analysis to computational analysis using the RAVE backend.
A analysis generally comprises the configuration of a workflow by the addition of a resource bundle and one or more pieces of sample data, in conjunction with the parameter sets desired for the workflow.

### BAM
Binary Alignment/Map

### BED
Browser Extensible Data

## COSMIC
Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer

## CRAM

## CWL

### Data
A piece of data either resulting from genomic or computational experiments, or to represent an aggregated relationship between more primitive data.

## dbSNP
The Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Database (dbSNP) is a free public archive for genetic variation within and across different species developed and hosted by the NCBI in collaboration with the NHGR.

### Folder
An organizational aid for the containment of data in GMS.

### GATK
[Genome Analysis Tool Kit](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2928508/), a structured programming framework designed to ease the development of efficient and robust analysis tools for next-generation DNA sequencers using the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce.

### GFF
The **general feature format (GFF)** is a file format used for describing genes and other features of DNA, RNA and protein sequences.

## GMS
Genomic Management System

## GTF
The **gene transfer format (GTF)** is a file format used to hold information about gene structure.
It is a tab-delimited text format based on the GFF, but contains some additional conventions specific to gene information.

### hg19
[hg19](https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway?db=hg19)

### VQSR
Variant Quality Score Recalibration

### RAU
Release auto update

### SAM
The Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM) format is a generic alignment format for storing read alignments against reference sequences, supporting short and long reads (up to 128 Mbp) produced by different sequencing platforms.
